                    <p>A nationwide fleet management company needed a more accurate solution to predict tire wear, optimize maintenance, and enhance safety. Traditional methods, like manual inspections and mileage-based predictions, were often inaccurate, time-consuming, and led to either costly premature replacements or dangerous delays in tire maintenance.</p>
                    <p>By implementing Shodat eOpsâ„¢, the manufacturer is aiming to enhance their tire wear prediction capabilities.
