              <p>
                A large manufacturing company faced significant challenges in
                maintaining workplace safety due to the complex and hazardous
                nature of its operations. Traditional safety monitoring methods
                were insufficient to prevent incidents and ensure regulatory
                compliance. To address these issues, the company implemented
                Shodat eOpsâ„¢, an advanced asset tracking and quality management
                platform.

                    areas,environmental monitoring for Hazardous
                    Conditions,workplace injury reports and real-time data from
