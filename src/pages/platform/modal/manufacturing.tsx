              <p>
                A leader in the manufacturing industry needed an effective
                solution for detecting and addressing structural cracks in
                product components. Traditional inspection methods were
                labour-intensive, error-prone, and time-consuming. To enhance
                their crack detection capabilities, the company implemented the
                Shodat eOpsâ„¢platform.
              </p>
              <div className={`${styles.result} ${styles.desktop}`}>

                  <p>
                    Achieved a 30% improvement in crack detection accuracy due
                    to Precision Detection Beyond the Human Eye with advanced
                    machine learning models and real-time data integration which
                    was earlier Time-consuming, inconsistent, and prone to human
                    error.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    By leveraging Shodat eOps, the client was able to identify
                    and address potential hazards before they escalated,
                    resulting in a 32 % decrease in high severity incidents.
